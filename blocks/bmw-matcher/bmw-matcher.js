 * BMW Matcher — Adobe Edge Delivery Services (EDS) block.

 * results rendering and share links are handled here. The scoring engine and
 * car dataset live behind an API (see server/) so they never reach the
 * browser — the block fetches the quiz definition and match results over HTTP.
 *
 * The API base comes from an authored "API" config row when running on EDS
 * (authored content can set config rows but not HTML attributes), or from a
 * `data-api` attribute for the local harness and the GitHub Pages build,
 * falling back to http://localhost:8787 for local preview. See apiBase.
 *
 * Share links encode the quiz answers in the URL hash (#m=<base64url>); the
 * link is decoded/validated client-side (quiz-meta.js), then the results are
 * re-fetched from the API.
