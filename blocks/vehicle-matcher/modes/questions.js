 * Questions mode — the original, question-by-question matcher interface.

 * page and refinement. The shell reads brand/retailer/config and hands this
 * mode a `ctx` and a stage element to render into via `mount(root, ctx)`.

 * The scoring engine and car dataset live behind an API (see server/ and

 * HTTP and never sees the dataset.
 *
 * Share links encode the quiz answers in the URL hash (#m=<base64url>); the

 * re-fetched from the API. Deep-linking is owned here rather than by the shell

 * The page could already say *the closest here misses your brief* and had no
 * words for *nothing here is close*, so a 67% leader was announced in exactly
 * the same voice as an 85% one. Rob Jennings is in the persona set to test
 * that: he walks away when "the tool recommends rather than filters", and
 * winning him looks like the tool saying "we do not have the right car for you
 * this week" when that is true.
 *
 * TWO CONDITIONS, and the first is what makes the sentence true. The state only
 * fires over a leader that already carries a trade-off, i.e. it is `closest`
 * escalated rather than a new population. A car that meets every stated want
 * and scores 63 is a car we DO have in the shape and fuel asked for; telling
 * that buyer "nothing here matches your brief" would be false on its face, and
 * the low score is coming from budget position or practicality, which the
 * cards already show.
 *
 * SIXTY-EIGHT, measured. Replayed matchCars over fixtures/*-cars.json two ways
 * — 40 retailers × 25 uniform answer sets per brand, and every persona's answers
 * perturbed one question at a time (the `stick` model, because uniform sampling
 * pairs combinations nobody picks) — and took the score distribution of the
 * population this splits, the `closest` pages:
 *
 *   BMW uniform     513 closest pages   median 69   p25 60  p75 78
 *   BMW personas     91 closest pages   median 67   p25 66  p75 71
 *   MINI uniform    590 closest pages   median 68   p25 59  p75 78
 *   MINI personas     8 closest pages   (too few to read)
 *
 * There is NO cliff in that distribution — it is unimodal and wide — so the
 * threshold is a policy choice about how often the tool is willing to say no,
 * and the only defensible place to put it is the middle of the population it
 * divides. Three independent samples put that at 67, 68 and 69. The state
 * therefore covers roughly the worse half of `closest` pages, which is ~24% of
 * realistic pages on BMW and ~2% on MINI (Sytner Luton's stock simply fits the
 * MINI personas well).
 *
 * Rob lands at 67 and fires; Martin at 71 does not, and that is a consequence
 * of the median rather than the target — worth saying plainly, because Rob's
 * page turns out to be an ordinary `closest` page rather than an outlier.
 * Martin belongs in `closest`: his page already tells him straight (the rescue
 * note names the convertible and where it is), his ask IS met 18 miles away,
 * and his clause is about being handled, not about being told no.

 * ranked internally and captioned honestly on its own terms. Stacked
 * vertically they read as one list that isn't sorted: Priya's page ran 96, 95
 * → 78 → 99, 97, so it claimed two cars fit best and then showed a 99% one
 * scroll down. Nobody reads three lists. See docs/results-page-review.md.
 *
 * Grouped by place, because this block is authored onto ONE retailer's site. A
 * tool on Sytner's page whose answer is "go to Group 1 Bedford" is answering a
 * different question than the page implies. So the groups are the retailer's
 * cars and then everyone else's, sorted by score inside each, and the headline
 * is derived from the retailer's cars because that is what it is scoped to.
 *
 * The governing rule, and the reason this isn't a rebuild of the bands it
 * replaced: GROUPS MAY DESCRIBE PLACE. THEY MAY NEVER CLAIM QUALITY. The old
 * page broke because "Close, but not level with the cars above" and "two of
 * these fit you equally well" were both quality claims on the same scale made
 * by different sections, so one could contradict the other. "At Grassicks
 * Garage" and "At other retailers" assert nothing about fit, so a 99% in the
 * second group contradicts nothing in the first.
 *
 * Every card still says where it is (see matchCard's provenance line). The
 * group heading is a signpost, not the only place that fact lives.
 *
 * Nearby stock arrives late (a slow national search) and joins the same pool
 * through `addToPool`, which is why the pool is mutable and the headline is
 * derived rather than fixed.
 *
 * The headline is re-derived on every redraw from the scores actually on
 * screen, never from the card count. That fixes a class of lie rather than one
 * instance: "TWO OF THESE FIT YOU EQUALLY WELL" was rendered over a 96% and a
 * 73% because narrowing back-filled the set to keep its size and nothing
 * re-tested the claim. Back-filling is right; not re-checking was not.
 *
 * Two rules the plan insists on, both still here: an applied refinement is
 * always shown and always revocable (a chip you can't see is a filter you
 * can't argue with), and narrowing to nothing is a legitimate outcome that
 * must be explained rather than rendered as an empty grid.
 *

 * @param {HTMLElement} lede the framing line, dropped once one car remains
